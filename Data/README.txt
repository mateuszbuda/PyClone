In this folder there are four files generated by mixing healthy tissue from four individuals. Each experiment was done
in varying proportions as described in "Detection of low prevalence somatic mutations in solid tumors with ultra-deep 
targeted sequencing". These four samples correspond to experiments Cal-A - Cal-D from that paper run on MiSEQ.
